4.-Edit the res/values/theme_config.xml to your needs.

5.-Edit the different drawables in there.

6.-You can add CUSTOM ICONS putting them inside the proper drawable directory following this name conventions:
	6.a: LowercaseActivityNameWithUnderscoresInsteadDots.png
	6.b example: "com_android_camera_camera.png" for camera activity (com.android.camera.Camera)
	6.c ecample2: "com_android_browser_browseractivity.png" for internet browser activity (com.android.browser.BrowserActivity)

7.-Rename res/xml/noShader.xml to shader.xml to enable icon shading. See the file for instructions on writing a shader.

8.-To put icons in the ADW Icon pack to be used in ADW.Launcher, just edit the res/values/icon_pack.xml file and add lines like the following one:
        <item>png_finelane_no_extension</item>
        One line per icon to be shown in the icon pack. Use only images, not xml drawables.
        EXAMPLES:
        	res/drawable/icon1.png --> <item>icon1</item>
        	res/drawable-hdpi/my_cool_icon.png --> <item>my_cool_icon</item>
		FULL FILE:
			<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
			<resources>
			    <string-array name="icon_pack" translatable="false">
			    	<item>icon1</item>
			    	<item>my_cool_icon</item>
			    </string-array>
			</resources>

9.-To use a custom font on your theme, put the TTF file in assets/themefont.ttf.
    Make sure the font is working, some BIG (in filesize) fonts or bad encoded fonts can cause problems.
     		
10.-Export the apk from eclipse as every other android app.
